# Exploring Adaptive Introgression in Modern Human Circadian Rhythm Genes


This repository contains scripts and resources used in the study "Exploring Adaptive Introgression in Modern Human Circadian Rhythm Genes," which is currently available as a preprint on bioRxiv. The research focuses on understanding how adaptive introgression from archaic humans, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, has influenced circadian rhythm genes in modern human populations.
